# Overview

This is the first attempt to build a Github organization page for our SBDL Lab. 

We can share scripts, results (probably should make them private), articles of interests, or anything else on here to serve as a lab-wide resource. Personally, this seems more flexible than grabbing files off from the lab server. In the future, we may consider inviting our undergraduate RAs as viewers/users of the space, but for now, let's try this out among graduate students. 

Github has interesting features that could facilitate collaboration on many aspects, e.g., project planning (to-do list, track progress, deadlines, etc), code collaboration (writing codes together and seeing each other's updates without having to email scripts in any way; all updates are automatic and tracked!)
